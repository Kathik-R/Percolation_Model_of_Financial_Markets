# Percolation_Model_of_Financial_Markets

Most financial theories, such as Black-Scholes Model (1973), assume the 
normal distribution of stock price returns. However, stock prices fluctuate 
by greater magnitudes and with greater frequency than what the Gaussian 
model predicts. The NIFTY 50 Index has shown daily percentage returns 
beyond -5% and +5%, 51 times since January 2000. The Gaussian model 
would need a considerably larger period to witness such extreme 
fluctuations. 
Percolation theory, a branch of statistical physics, is used to model the local 
interactions between traders in a market. Stauffer and Penna (1998) also 
incorporated percolation theory to model financial markets. Their model 
was based on the herding effect, which assumes that traders follow the 
market trends without the analysis of the economic data available to them. 
Stauffer and Penna assumed that people form a cluster sharing the same 
information by going to a neighbourhood bank or broker for investment 
opinions. 
The objective of this paper is to show that the market returns are not 
normally distributed and check if the fat tails can be explained by local 
interactions between traders in stock markets. The hypothesis that has 
been made is that the traders are interested only on the price fluctuations 
of their own stocks and have no interest in those they do not hold. Since the 
price variation affects only those traders who have invested in the said 
stock, the result is a localised interaction between traders with their 
actions affecting the others involved.
